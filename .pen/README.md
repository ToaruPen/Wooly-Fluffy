# .pen

Pencil design source files live here.

- Keep `.pen` files version-controlled.
- Use screen-oriented names, e.g. `kiosk-main.pen`, `staff-main.pen`.
- Keep screenshot outputs in `var/screenshot/...` (not in this directory).

## Initial files

- `kiosk-main.pen`
- `staff-main.pen`
- `components.pen`

## OpenCode MCP check

- Run `opencode mcp list` and ensure `pencil` is `connected`.
- If disconnected, start the Pencil desktop app and run the command again.
