# GC / doc-gardening starter template.
#
# What this workflow does:
# - Runs repo-local checks (currently: docs/SoT lint) on a schedule.
# - Leaves evidence in the GitHub Actions logs.
#
# What this workflow intentionally does NOT do:
# - It does not open Issues/PRs or push commits.
#
# Recovery / collection (choose one for your repo):
# - Create a small PR that fixes the findings (recommended), or
# - Create an Issue that tracks the findings and assigns an owner.
